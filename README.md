Your goal is to implement an application that allows employees of a certain perfume store to place customer order. Your application should:

 get customer information including name, telephone number and address (one field for each).

 ask for the method of payment: Visa, MasterCard, or cash.

 ask for customer credit card number if he/she selected Visa or MasterCard

 have four types of perfume (House of Sillage Cherry Garden for $1,150.00, Tom Ford Neroli Portofino for $695.00, Cartier Oud &amp; Rose for 380.00, &amp; Viktor&amp;Rolf Flowerbomb for $170.95) and five types of accessories (Spinning Perfume Organizer $165.70, Atomizer spray bottle $139.99, Perfume tray $91.90, 2 tiers cosmetic organizer $85.00, and Mist Spray $52.65). Perfumes and accessories prices are shown on the screen next to each item (see list of menus below). The total price should include tax at rate of 9.75%. (Assume the customers could place one order at a time)

 Gifts – Customers get a gift if they select 2 or more distinctive accessories. Selecting 2 accessories: Lipstick; select 3 accessories: Lip pencil; select 4 or more accessories: Eyeshadow. Note: Maximum one gift per order; Customer may not select a gift.

 calculate the total price when the user selects “Display Order Confirmation”. When the user selects the “Display Order Confirmation” option:

 if input is complete, your application must generate the order confirmation shown below.

 if input is incomplete, your application must generate one message, listing all fields requiring completion. The user should be able to input data in any order. Use function (call-by-value only). Do not use global variables. Do not use arrays. Make sure to test your program completely before submission. Do not forget to add comments.

Submit your well-documented C++ program via Canvas. The order confirmation should look like this:
